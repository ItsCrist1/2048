# 2048
A fast cross-platform C++ terminal implementation of the classic game [2048](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)).

# Features
- Saving and loading game states with custom settings
- Lots of settings for customization
- Custom colored cells
- Drawing tables with ASCII table symbols
- Really fast on all systems

# Compatibility
Works great with both Windows (not sure about windows 7 or older) and UNIX systems.
Linux has the best compatibility though (most of the code was written in termux).
